This is a quick and dirty way of having a multi-node cluster non HA on a single machine for trainning and demo purposes. There are a couple of ansible playbooks and a Vagrant file to bring up a full kuberenetes cluster.

### Target audience 
People beginning with containers and container orchestraion that want to have the most simple local environment as possible but with everything needed to test application and kubernetes components, operators, addons, plugins etc. Also simple and predictable environment to build demos and workshops.

### Prerequisites
- ansible
- vagrant 

### How to use
cd into your directory. Vagrant up. That's all.
